        Hello, my name is Ornit and programming has always been a part of my life and I love it, so I decided to make a career out of it. I have a bachelor degree in Biology and during my studies I took a course in Python and fell in love with the programming world. I love Biology and this field is very much dear to my heart and I will always integrate it in my career somehow, but I've learned that programming is something I enjoy even more and my abilities are being utilized properly in this field. After I finished my degree, I started learning basic C on my own and knew very quickly that this is something I want and I am capable of doing until retirement.
